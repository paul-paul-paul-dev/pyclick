# PyClick

Small python auto clicker.

Mainly used for clicker browser games like this one [Lhama Clicker](https://de.crazygames.com/spiele/lhama-clicker) :D

When you run the program, you have the following options:

```sh
'a' -> Start and Stop the auto clicker  
'b' -> Stop the whole program (fail-safe)
```

This program can not become sentient and take over your computer, i hope...

So no worries ðŸ™‚
